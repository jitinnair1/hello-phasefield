# Programs to code:

1) ~~Create Phase diagram from GX curves~~ (Completed)
2) ~~Mark Spinodal in the phase diagram~~ (Completed)
3) Simple diffusion profile using explicit method
4) Simple diffusion profile using implicit method
5) Explicit method with right end kept at C=0 (Dirichlet Boundary)
6) Implicit method with right end kept at C=0 (Dirichlet Boundary)
7) Implement implicit and explicit method with periodic boundary conditions
8) Explicit spectral method using FFT
9) Vary initial profile and solve the problems
10) Take initial noise around 0.5 and see the evolution
